# logik
Logical expression parser in Kotlin. 
Can handle syntax directly copy/pasted from either LaTeX code or a compiled LaTeX document.
Generation of truth tables is supported under `LogikStatement.truthTable()`.
Everything is fully documented inside of project.

I wrote this to automate my CS 202 psets. Turned out we stopped doing truth tables pretty quick but it was still fun :)
